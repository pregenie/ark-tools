# 🚀 START HERE - ARK-TOOLS Setup

## For First-Time Users: One Simple Command

```bash
./ark-setup web
```

## What Happens Next:

You'll see this output:
```
✅ Found available port: 8082
🌐 Starting ARK-TOOLS Web UI at http://localhost:8082
   Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

## Open that URL in your browser!

In this example, you'd open: **http://localhost:8082**

(Your port number might be different - use whatever the command shows you)

## That's literally it! 

The web interface will handle everything else:
- Detecting your services
- Finding existing configurations
- Testing connections
- Saving your setup

---

**No ports to remember. No configuration files to edit. Just one command.**
